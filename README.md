A simple Chain-of-Responsibility/Interactor gem that helps MVC applications organise their business logic, keeping their models and controllers skinny and their logic easily testable.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'laminar'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install laminar

## Usage
### 'Skinny' Controllers AND 'Skinny' Models

Even if you are reasonably new to Model-View-Controller (MVC) frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails, you have likely encountered the advice to have 'skinny controllers, fat models'. 'Skinny' controllers (i.e., simple, small, single-responsibility) are indeed best, but pushing a lot of code into your models has its own issues, and it isn't in reality an either/or choice.

Separating your business logic into single-purpose service objects (also sometimes called 'interactors' and several other names) helps keep your models and controllers skinny, and your code DRY and more easily testable.

### Particles

A particle is a PORO (Plain Old Ruby Object) that encapsulates a piece of your business logic. Keeping with the Single Responsibility Principle, a particle should preferably do only one thing.

#### Defining a Particle
A particle is a plain Ruby class that includes `Laminar::Particle` and defines a `call` method.

```ruby
class ChangeAddress
  include Laminar::Particle

  def call
    // change address logic goes here
  end
end
```

#### Particle Context

To invoke a particle, invoke the `.call` method on the particle's
class object, passing a Hash of values that is the 'context' in which
the particle runs.
```ruby
ChangeAddress.call(user: user, new_address: addr)
```

The invoked particle accesses its context within its `.call` method like  normal Hash:
```ruby
sku = context[:product_sku]
```

The particle can also add to or modify the context. The context is returned to the invoker, which can then access the modified context.

```ruby
// Particle
class OpenTicket
  include Laminar::Particle

  def call
    context[:status] = :pending
  end
end

// Caller
result = OpenTicket.call
if result[:status] != :pending
  ...
end
```

#### Keyword Arguments

You can also use keyword arguments particle's `.call` method:
```ruby
class ChangeAddress
  include Laminar::Particle

  def call(user:, new_address:)
    // change address logic goes here
  end
end
```

When you declare keyword arguments, Laminar passes matching values
from the context to your particle. This can make your particle more
self-documenting and provides a simple `ArgumentError` exception if the
calling context does not contain the minimum information required for the
particle to function.

The `.call` implementation always has access to the full context via
`context` whether or not you declare keyword arguments.

#### Particle Success / Failure
Particles have a simple mechanism for flagging success and
failure. To signal failure, simply call `.fail` on the context.
```ruby
context.fail!
```

There are also convenience methods for checking success/failure:
```ruby
context.success? # => true by default
context.failed? # => false
context.fail!
context.failed? # => true
context.success? # => false
```

The `.fail` method accepts a hash that is merged into the context,
making it convenient to attach error information:
```ruby
context.fail!(error: 'The user is allergic to bananas!')
```

### Flows

A flow is a chained sequence of particles, creating a simple workflow.
Each step (particle) contributes to an overall outcome through a shared
context. Simple branching and looping is supported via conditional
logic.

A flow includes `Laminar::Flow`, which provides a DSL for specifying
the particles to execute. The most basic flow is a simple set of steps executed sequentially.

```ruby
class FillCavity
  include Laminar::Flow

  flow do
    step :numb_mouth
    step :drill_cavity
    step :apply_amalgam
  end
end
```

A step label must be a symbol that identifies a Particle. By default,
the Flow assumes the step label is the implementation class name (i.e.,
`:numb_mouth` -> `NumbMouth`).
You can use the `class:` directive to specify an alternate class
name. Very useful when your particles
are organised into modules.
```ruby
class FillCavity
  include Laminar::Flow

  flow do
    step :numb_mouth
    step :drill_cavity, class: 'Dentist::Drill'
    step :apply_amalgam
  end
end
```

#### Invoking a Flow
Flows behave exactly like Particles in terms of execution. To start
a Flow, call `.call` on the Flow class, passing a Hash of context:

```ruby
// Flow
class FillCavity
  include Laminar::Flow

  flow do
    step :numb_mouth
    step :drill_cavity, class: 'Dentist::Drill'
    step :apply_amalgam
  end
end

// Caller
result = FillCavity.call(patient: patient, tooth_number: tooth)
```

A Flow returns the context as it stands after the final step in the
Flow ends. Because Flows behave exactly like Particles, they can be
nested as steps inside other flows without issue:

```ruby
class FillCavity
  include Laminar::Flow

  flow do
    step :check_equipment # Flow
    ...
  end
end

class CheckEquipment
  include Laminar::Flow

  flow do
    ...
  end
end
```

#### Flow Branching
Ordinarily particle execution is sequential in the order specified.
However, you can optionally branch to a different label with `goto`.
```ruby
  flow do
    step :do_something do
      goto :final_step      
    end
    step :another_step # skipped
    step :final_step
  end
```

You can use the special symbol :endflow to jump terminate the flow
(skipping all remaining steps).

```ruby
  flow do
    step :do_something do
      goto :endflow
    end
    step :another_step # skipped
    step :final_step # skipped
  end
```

#### Conditional Branching

Branches can be made conditional with the `if_true:` and `if_false:`
directives.

```ruby
  flow do
    step :first do
      goto :last_step, if_true: :done_early?      
    end
    step :then_me
    step :do_something
    step :last_step
  end
```

The target of `if_true:` or `if_false:` is a symbol naming a method on the invoking Flow.

```ruby
  flow do
    step :first do
      goto :last_step, if_true: :done_early?      
    end
    ...
  end

  def done_early?
    !context[:finished].nil? && context[:finished] == true
  end
```

A step can have multiple goto directives; the flow will take the first
branch that it finds that satisfies its specified condition (if any). If
no condition is satisfied, execution drops to the next step.

```ruby
  flow do
   step :first do
     goto :last_step, if: :condition1?
     goto :do_something, if: :condition2?
   end
   step :then_me # executed if neither condition1 nor condition2
   step :do_something
   step :last_step
  end
```
